# CATALYST 2018: Exploring Digital Intelligence

Digital intelligence consists of the use of digital computers to perform intelligent tasks, from automatically recognizing objects in pictures to manuevering an autonomous vehicle. In this research project, we will explore the process of creating and implementing intelligence in machines. In particular, we will study how to combine state-of-the-art hardware and software to perceive, process, and learn from real-world information and assemble a practical hardware-software system with demonstratable intelligence. 

This week-long design experience includes three guided laboratory sessions to familiarize us with concepts in hardware, software, and machine intelligence. Based on knowledge acquired from the laboratory session, we will work in groups to build an end-to-end prototype of an intelligent machine. Here is an overview of the design activities:

### Lab 1
We will start with learning the concepts of hardware because hardware is the foundation required to build and run our intelligent machines. We will experiment with basic analog and digital circuits and have the opportunity to build digital elements from a simple logic gate to a more complex arithmetic unit.

### Lab 2
We will then learn to write software to program the behavior of hardware. Using an Arduino-based robotics platform, you will write software programs to control various exploratory behaviors of a robot through actuators and enable the robot to perceive its surrounding environment through sensors and react appropriately.

### Lab 3
We will learn how to bring intelligence into machines by teaching a computer to recognize handwritten numerical digits. We will learn and implement the popular K-Nearest-Neighbor machine learning algorithm to decipher different handwritten digits using a distance-based measure.

### Project
We will combine hardware, software, and machine intelligence to build a cohesive Internet-connected intelligent system. Depending on the project selected, we will leverage our digit recognition system to wirelessly control the movement of the robot and take advantage of various sensors to enable autonomous behaviors such as rapid target finding and adaptive cruise control.
