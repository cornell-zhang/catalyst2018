# CATALYST 2018: Exploring Digital Intelligence

Digital intelligence consists of the use of digital computers to perform intelligent tasks, from automatically recognizing objects in pictures to manuevering an autonomous vehicle. In this research project, we will explore the process of creating and implementing intelligence in machines. In particular, we will study how to combine state-of-the-art hardware and software to perceive, process, and learn from real-world information and assemble a practical hardware-software system with demonstratable intelligence. 

This week-long design experience includes three guided laboratory sessions to familiarize us with concepts in hardware, software, and machine intelligence. Based on knowledge acquired from the laboratory session, we will work in groups to build an end-to-end prototype of an intelligent machine. Here is an overview of the design activities:

#### Lab 1
We will start with learning the concepts of hardware because hardware is the foundation required to build and run our intelligent machines. We will experiment with basic analog and digital circuits and have the opportunity to build digital elements from a logic gate to an arithmetic unit.
