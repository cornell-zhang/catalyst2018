Projects
======================

Intelligent electronic systems are broadly applied in many applications including in IoT devices and auto-driving systems.  For the final project, you are going to choose one of the following two competitions.

Proposals
--------------------------------

### 1. Rapid Targeting System:
In this competition, students will build a robot which is able to quickly arrive at the destination. You should use the digit recognition system built in lab3 to start the robot.  For instance, if you draw the number “5” on the canvas, the predicting result should be “5” and it will be sent to the robot, the robot will start targeting the destination after spinning around 5 times. You should teach the robot how to rapidly find the destination.

### 2. Adaptive Cruise System:
In this competition, students will build a robot equipped with the adaptive cruise system. To avoid any crash, the moving speed of robots is controlled by the cruise system based on the distance measured by the infrared sensor. Also, you should control the moving direction of robots using the digit recognition system built in lab3. In specific, if you draw the number “1” on the canvas, the predicting result should be “1” and it will be sent to the robot, the robot will turn right/left.
