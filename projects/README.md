Projects
======================

Intelligent electronic systems are broadly applied in many applications including in IoT devices and auto-driving systems.  For the final project, you are going to choose one of the following two competitions.

Proposals
--------------------------------

### 1. Rapid Targeting System:
In this competition, students will build a robot who is able to quickly arrive at the destination. You should use the digit recognition system built in lab3 to start the robot.  For instance, if you draw the number “5” on the canvas, the predicting result should be “5” and it will be sent to the robot, the robot will start targeting the destination after spinning around 5 times. You should teach the robot how to rapidly find the destination.

### 2. Adaptive Cruise System:
In this competition, students will build an adaptive cruise system. You should build two robots: the front one could be remotely controlled by the digit recognition system and is responsible to lead the back one, which is equipped with the adaptive cruise system. In specific, you could control the motion (forward, backward, stop, and change directions) of the front robot within the number drawn on the canvas. And the back robot should smartly perform the same action as the front one based on its adaptive cruise system.
