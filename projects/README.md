Projects
======================

Intelligent electronic systems are broadly used in many applications including smart house, health monitor, and auto-control systems. To further explore the digital intelligence, you will build an intelligent system by implementing simple machine learning algorithms like KNN, linear regression, and decision tree. You should first collect some data and train your model, then verify its functionality, and finally display the classification/prediction on the TFT screen or use it to control the robot.

Proposals
--------------------------------

### 1. Digit Recognition:

In this project, students will build a more powerful integrated digit recognition system, which is able to apply the IoT box to check the predictions. Based on the web-based digit recognition system built in lab3, you should implement a chat channel between the server and an Arduino-embedded IoT box so that it could receive the predicting result and display it on the TFT screen.
