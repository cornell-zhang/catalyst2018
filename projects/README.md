Projects
======================

The goal of the final project is combine your knowledge in hardware, software, and machine intelligence to build a cohesive Internet-connected intelligent system. While there is a broad range of applications that can leverage such a system, for the purpose of the final project, you are going to choose one of the following representative application scenarios. You will be working in a group of around 8 students to collaboratively complete the project of your choice.

### [1. Rapid Targeting System](Rapid%20Targeting%20System)
For this application scenario, you will build a robot that is able to locate its target faster and more efficiently. Students will use the same wooden maze as in Lab 2, but should program more sophisticated control behaviors that allow the robots to reach their targets in a much shorter period of time. New behaviors may include infrared mapping, for example, to allow the robot to determine the direction in which the object in front of the robot is the farthest away. This should allow the robot to determine a shorter route to the target from its current position.  As an additional challenge, students will develop a remote mechanism to manually control the starting orientation of the robot by asking the robot to rotate a specific number of degrees using the digit recognition system from Lab 3. Students should use WiFi communication to send a digit to the robot, which in turn rotates the robot accordingly so it faces a good starting orientation. After changing its starting orientation, the robot should proceed to rapidly navigate the maze to reach its target. Groups will compete for the shortest amount of time it takes their robots to reach the target.


### [2. Adaptive Cruise Control System](Adaptive%20Cruise%20Control%20System)
For this application scenario, you will build a robot equipped with an adaptive cruise control system that is able to adjust the robot's speed and avoid collision based on its distance to any object or vehicle in front of it. Students will be responsible for modeling such a system by, for example, programming the speed of the robot based on values received from the front-facing infrared sensor. With this capability, the robot will be able to cruise autonomously in the presence of other robots and obstacles while avoiding any frontal collision. In addition, to allow remote control of the speed of the robot while it is in motion, you will also implement a speed control module by incorporating the digit recognition system used in Lab 3. Students should use WiFi communication to send a digit to the robot, which in turn adjusts the robot's speed accordingly. For instance, if the digit "0" is drawn in the web app canvas, the digit recognition system should predict "0", which is sent to the robot to ask the robot to stop. If a larger digit is sent, the robot should then accelerate to a pre-determined speed. Regardless of the user-defined speed, the robot should slow down or stop if deemed necessary due to obstacles.
